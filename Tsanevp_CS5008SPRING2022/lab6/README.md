# Lab 6: Testing with Google Test suite
## CS 5008: Spring 2022
## Who I worked with:
* For this lab, I did not work with any other individuals.
## How long the lab took me:
* In total, this lab took me around five hours. The first part of the lab was very simple and cool to learn (testing),
  but the second half, working with trees, was tough. I had a hard time coming up with an algorithm to determine if the
  tree was actually a BST. I was trying to make it simple and within one recursive function, but ended up just making
  two helper functions that call the left side of the tree recursively, and the right side recursively.
## What I liked:
I liked the fact that we now have a way to test our code and functions to ensure they work as we expect, even for edge
cases. Further, it was cool learning more about trees and creating algorithms that work on them specifically.
