# Lab 5: Style and cLint
## Who I worked with:
* For this lab, I did not work with any other individuals.
## How long the lab took me:
* In total, this lab took me around an hour. I was fairly straightfowrward. 
I just took some extra time to understand cLint and how to use it. It was
very similart to the pycodestyle I am used to in python which is cool.
## File Chosen:
I chose to clean up my linkedlist.c file from a3. It is the file that creates
and defines a doubly linked list. The most common error was not adding
proper spacing in the my for loop definition lines. I had like 15 of those
same errors, so it was annoying to go back and fix only them.
## What I liked:
I liked the fact that we now have a method of checking for errors in our
code!!!
