### README Lab02
## Who did you work with?
I mainly worked alone, but if I got stuck on any C formatting issues, I would work through them with Brian.
## What external resources did you use?
I used SO to get information on creating a string array and then sending it into a fuction as a pointer to the first string character.
## How long did it take you?
Overall, I think the lab took me about two to three hours. The problems were fairly simple, it just took me a while to understand the proper formatting of C.
## What did you like about this lab?
I liked the problems. They were simple, yet offered a good way of getting familiar with C.
## What would you change about this lab?
Nothing.
