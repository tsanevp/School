# Lab 8: Parser Lab

## My Name:
Peter Tsanev

## Time Spent On Assignment:
I spent about 45 min on this lab. Once I read the documentation on strtok and fgets, it wasn't too bad.

## Did you collaborate with others?
I did not collaborate with others and worked only by myself.

## Did you use any external resources?
I used stackoverflow to determine the cause of one of my errors while using strtok. Turns out I had forgotten to import
string.h library.

## What did you like about this assignment?
Using the user input fgets. I miss it from python.
