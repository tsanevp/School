# Lab 10: Bash Scripting

## My Name:
Peter Tsanev

## Time Spent On Assignment:
I spent around an hour on this lab. I mainly spent time looking up ideas for functions to implement. I also had to look
up proper syntax.

## Did you collaborate with others?
I did not collaborate with others and worked only by myself.

## Did you find this excercise useful?
This excercise and lab was useful. I think it is a very good intro to the power of scripting, and I will definitely come
back to it over the summer to create some cool scripts.
