# Assignment A3

## My Name:
Peter Tsanev

##  Objectives
* Start working with `structs`, `header files`, `linked lists`, `sorting algorithms`.
* Doing more advanced things with `structs` and `data structures`.
* Work with `linked lists` and `arrays` to create multiple sorting algorithms.

## Summary/Overview
For part 1 of this assignment, we started playing around with `linked lists`, `header files`, and `sorting` algorithms. We
were given the header file for a doubly-linked list, and had the task of implementing its methods. After doing so,
we tasked with creating an insertion sort algorithm that would essentially sort the doubly-linked list. Once this was
complete, we had to print out the unsorted, and sorted linked lists, showing that the sort actually works.

For part 2 of this assignment, we were tasked with implementing a quicksort algorithm, a hybrid quicksort, and some
other sorting algorithm. We were originally given the quicksort already complete, and needed to create a new sorting
algorithm, and a hybrid quicksort. I decided to create a standard quicksort, a selection sort, and a insertion/quicksort
hybrid. The runtime of each sort is then compared with different size interger arrays, to see which is has smaller run
times as the array size grows.

To run the program, type `make -f Makefile` in the command line, and both part 1 and part 2 will run at the same time.

### About The Code
The code does not reley on any external libraries except <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, and <time.h>.

## Running and testing a2.c
As mentioned, to run both part 1 and part 2, type `make -f Makefile` in the terminal, and both will compile and execute.

## Time Spent On Assignment:
Overall I spent about a 30 hours on this assignment. It was a bit more time than I had expected, but it was worth in.
Coming into this assignment I was not too familiar with pointers, malloc(), and linked lists overall, but now I feel
like I can code anything. I am definitely more knowledgable in coding and c, and learned alot throughout this
assignment.

## What did you like about this assignment?
I really liked working with linked lists and coming up with various sorts.

## How could this assignment be improved?
This assignment could have been improved if some of the instructions were a bit more clear for part 2. Overall, 
other than clarity, everything was good.
