# README Quesitons Lab01
## Who did you work with?
I worked alone on this lab.
## What external resources did you use?
I used the links provided on the Lab01 module, along with a few youtube videos I found on how to download and installVirtualBox and Ubuntu.
## How long did it take you?
The lab took me about 45 min. I had already installed the VM and Putty to SSH into the Khoury servers. The only tasksI had left to do was to read through the module, and complete all the requirements.
## What did you like about this lab?
I liked how detailed the module was and that it included optional external links for additional help/reading if wanted. 
## What would you change about this lab?
I would make sure all the links work in the module. There were a few that gave me an error b/c they tried to direct me to a page that was not public on canvas.
