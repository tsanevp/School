# Lab 7: Bash Lab
## CS 5008: Spring 2022
## Who I worked with:
* For this lab, I did not work with any other individuals.
## How long the lab took me:
* In total, this lab took me around five hours. Shell scripting is def a really cool concept that has the ability to
  make the life of a programmer much easier. It gives us the ability to create shortcut functions that do various
  things.
## Bells & Whistles of script:
* Ideally, my script first pulls and prints any new directories or files, I type the name of a file to copy to my
  personal directory, and if that file does not already exist in my directory, it gets copied over. It is hard to fully
  test my script, as the CourseResources directory is up-to-date, but I plan to test and update it as new files get
  added to the course repo.
