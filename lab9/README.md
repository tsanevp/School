# Lab 9: Threads

## My Name:
Peter Tsanev

## Time Spent On Assignment:
I spent about 45 min on this lab. Once I read additional documentation and watched a couple of videos on threads and
semaphors, the lab wasn't too bad.

## Did you collaborate with others?
I did not collaborate with others and worked only by myself.

## Did you use any external resources?
I found a really good youtube channel that had a playlist on threads. I ended up watching the entire playlist to gain a
deeper understanding on the topic. Below is one of the main videos.

## What did you like about this assignment?
Using the user input fgets. I miss it from python.
